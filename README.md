# Object-Detection-using-Transfer-Learning
Comparitive Analysis of different CNN architecture's for object detection on the CIFAR-10 dataset using transfer learning

This project evaluates the accuracy and performance of a number of convolutional neural network architectures for object detection using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Architectures like ResNet (ResNet-50 and ResNet-101), VGGNet (VGG-16 and VGG-19), MobileNet (MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3) and InceptionNetV3 are compared for their accuracy and computational efficiency. For this purpose, transfer learning is employed where the models are pretrained on the ImageNet dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.
